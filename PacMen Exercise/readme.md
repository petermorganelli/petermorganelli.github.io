# Pac-Men-Exercise

Description:
In this simple web application, the user is able to click a button that generates and randomly places a 'pacman' character on the screen. When the user clicks the 'start game' button, the pacmen bounce around infinitely in random directions and at random speeds. The 'stop' button will stop the movement.

How to run: Download the 'Pacmen-Exercise' folder to your local machine and then open up the index.html file in your web browser.
